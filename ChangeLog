	listing command to interpret the event.

2005-09-14 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>

	* ipmi.init: use poweroff_control or poweroff_powercycle module
	option to ipmi_poweroff as appropriate.  kernel 2.6.14-rc1
	(driver 36.0) and newer uses poweroff_powercycle.

	way to tell if the domain is in shutdown.

	* lib/sensor.c: Don't allow operations if the domain/mc it is
	attached to is in shutdown or is not active.  There was a problem
	where if a sensor was getting refetched in the fetch completion
	handler, and it blew the stack because the fetch would go through
	the opq, fail, call the handler, start the fetch, etc.
	* lib/control.c: ditto

	* lib/sensor.c: Fix an error path in states_get_start() that was
	incorrectly returning success.  Fix a typo in a comment.

	return the wrong alert destination number with the response.

2005-08-18 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/oem_atca.c: When a hot-swap event comes in and the MC
	already exists, it is probably an AMC insertion/removal.
	Rescan the SDRs on the IPMC when this occurs, as it probably has
	new sensors.

	* lib/fru.c: Fix a problem with uninitialized variable FRU string
	data and another problem with encoding later fields after a
	changed field.

	destroyed.  Also fix some refcount problems on some error
	situations.
	* lib/sensor.c: Ditto, but for sensors.

	* lib/mc.c: Make sure the clear out the SDR repository to an
	intial state when the MC goes inactive.  Also add some useful
	error messages.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Fix the detection of going to or from not
	installed state to be correct.

	* lib/entity.c: Fixed a problem where if a presence sensor got an
	error on a reading, it would not continue to try other presence
	methods.

2005-04-20 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* unix/posix_os_h.c, unix/posix_thread_os_hnd.c: Fix incorrect
	return values from perform_one_op() in these os handlers.

	* sample/ipmicmd.c: When performoning a non-interactive operation,
	make sure to not exit in the message handler, because that is done

2005-02-24 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lib/entity.c: Ignore controls and sensors for presence if they
	are supposed to be ignored when the entity is not present.  I
	think I previously misunderstood this bit (not like it is well

	* cmdlang/cmd_entity.c: Add an "entity tree" command to dump
	the list of entities in a tree structure.

	* lib/fru.c: Add a new error to handle auto-resizing of FRU
	fetches with.

2005-02-11 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	comparison that does not use the LUN as part of the comparison.

	* lib/domain.c: Modify finding MCs to not use the LUN, since there
	may be multiple LUNs on an MC.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: In the Intel SDR fixups, added entity
	containment records for all the entities found in the SDRs.

2005-02-08 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lib/entity.c: Fixed some problems with the use of qsort and the
	sorting and comparing of device locator records and entity
	association records.

	* glib/Makefile.am: Changed the name of a field to be glib, not
	posix.

	* glib/glib_os_hnd.c: Clear out the glib info so the gdbmf will be
	NULL at startup.

	* lib/domain.c: Added a general domains_initialized function to
	know if the domain lock is valid.  This is because some things can
	try to do a ipmi_domain_pointer_cb() after the domains have been
	shut down.

	* lib/sdr.c: Only store the SDRs in the database if we have a
	valid key for the MC.

	* swig/OpenIPMI.i: Initialize the glib OS handler in the right
	order.

	* utils/ipmi_malloc.c: Don't free the memory in the alloced list

	ditto

	* lib/sdr.c: Add support for dynamically resizing SDR fetches if
	the system cannot support the size required.  This allowed an

	were supported.
	* lib/fru.c: Ditto, but for FRU data.

	* lib/domain.c: Fixed channel handling to not scan the IPMB if
	there is not one from the channel info command.  This may cause
	some broken 1.5 systems (that do not implement the get channel
	info command properly) to not work, but that's too bad, they are
	broken.  Systems without IPMB will work much better with this
	change.

	* include/OpenIPMI/os_handler.h: Added a database interface.
	***NOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTE**:
	This change is not binary backwards compatible if you have created
	your own OS handler.  If you have used the standard ones then it
	is ok.

	data in the database for client-side caching.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h, include/OpenIPMI/internal/ipmi_mc.h:
	Moved ipmi_mc_get_address, ipmi_mc_get_channel, and
	ipmi_mc_get_ipmi_address from the private to the public
	interfaces.

2005-01-13 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, lib/entity.c: Undeprecated the
	hot-swap requester and indicator command, since HPI provides them.
	I still think it's a bad idea to use them, though.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h, include/OpenIPMI/internal/ipmi_mc.h:
	Moved the ipmi_mc_del_event() function to the public interface.

	* lib/sel.c: Clear the SEL if the SEL is empty and the overflow
	flag is set.  This appears the clear the overflow flag (at least
	on some systems) and is safe to do.

	* lib/sel.c: Fixed a bug where if the reservation was lost
	fetching a SEL, it would not fetch anything from the SEL until a
	new event was added.

	* lib/entity.c: Found a problem with disconnect/reconnect; it was
	claiming a lock recursively in one case.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h.in, lib/entity.c: Deprectated the
	ability to directly handle the hot-swap indicators and requesters.

	* Practically_everything: More work on the include files, moved
	the internal/OEM include files to an "internal" directory, more
	restructure to make thing easier to use and make more clean
	definitions of what is and is not supported.

	This means that if you were naughty and used internal interfaces,
	you will have to change your code.

	* cmdlang/cmd_mc.c, cmdlang/cmd_domain.c, man/ipmi_cmdlang.7:
	Added beter support for the SELs.

	* lib/mc.c: Don't set the SEL time if that would move the time

2004-10-14 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* Practically_everything: A restructure of the include files
	so the ipmiif.h is really the only thing you need to include
	to do pretty much everything (except for the helper things like
	pefs, lanparm, pets, etc.).  There should no longer be any need
	for external user programs to use ipmi_domain.h, ipmi_mc.h,
	or things like that.

	to report the entities when they want to report them.

	* lib/entity.c: Make sure the entity add handler is called before
	calling the sensor update handlers.

	locking on MCs so that the device id data and the active
	indications are not changed until no one is using the MC.

	* lib/entity.c: Rework the locking on entities so that the DLR
	data does not change until no one is using the entity, and the
	changed indications are not reported until the entity is not in
	use.  Presence is also change to work this way, but it may need
	some more thinking.

2004-04-29 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* everything: A massive rework of the internals.  Basically,
	locking was reworked completely.  Now locks are *not* held in user
	callbacks.  Instead, items in callbacks are usecounted and will
	not be destroyed until the usecount goes to zero.  All the same
	rules apply, there are just no locks held.  This should avoid
	problems with deadlocks.

	* lib/domain.c, lib/entity.c: Worked on marking deprecated
	functions using GCC-specific attributes.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_types.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_entity.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_domain.h: ditto

	* lib/sel.c: Fixed a bug in the sel get where the info allocated
	can go away before the operation returns, but the info is used
	after the operation returns.

	* lib/sensor.c: Fix the hysteresis setting to send a message that
	is the right size.

2004-04-15 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lib/oem_intel.c: More work on getting the various Intel servers
	supported better.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h.in: Modified the hot-swap state
	machine slightly to support the ability to move to activation
	requested state from inactive state.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_entity.h, lib/entity.c: Added the calls
	for ipmi_entity_set_activation_requested() to the hot-swap
	variables.  The normal state machine will not support it.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Added support for setting the FRU activation
	policy with ipmi_entity_set_activation_requested().

	* configure.in: Move to version 1.3.5

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h, lib/mc.c: Added callbacks for
	knowing when the MC has finished reading its SDRs and reading the
	SEL for the first time.

2004-04-14 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lib/entity.c: Scan MCs from MCDLRs even if the information is
	not used for anything else.

2004-04-13 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lib/entity.c: Prefer to keep the MCDLR information for an entity
	that has FRU information, and don't try any FRU detection work if
	the MCDLR has FRU turned off.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Turn off setting the event reciever for the ATCA
	chassis (for now), since it seems to cause all kinds of bad things
	to happen.

	* lib/entity.c, lib/sensor.c: Some minor changes to entity
	presence detection.

2004-04-12 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lib/control.c, lib/sensor.c, lib/entity.c: Reworked the internal
	naming of these to make them consistent.

	* lib/domain.c: Fixed a nasty bug about MC deletion, basically
	don't delete MCs from the domain list while processing, because
	they can be the "next" item in the list and corrupt the list
	traversal.  Add a delayed delete operation.

	* lib/domain.c: Do the OEM startup check after fetching the MC
	information for the connection.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Fix a bunch of problems, add hacks for broken
	hardware.

	* lib/sensor.c: Destroy the handler list of a sensor on a
	duplicate sensor entry.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h: Added hacks to some of the
	interfaces to support wierd things.
	* lib/domain.c: ditto
	* lib/ipmi_lan.c: ditto
	* lib/ipmi_smi.c: ditto
	* lib/oem_atca.c: ditto

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp_intf.c: ditto

	* lib/domain.c: Added sending message straight to an interface if
	it matches the address of an interface.

	* lib/ipmi_lan.c: Added support for a wierd hack where the first
	IPMI address in a LAN message is 0x20, and the other one is the
	internal address.

	* lib/oem_atca_conn.c, lib/oem_atca.c: Added some hacks for the
	current bugs in the Intel ATCA box.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Reworked the handling of MCs and entity addition
	to happen after the user is informed of the domain.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_domain.h, lib/domain.c: Added a way for OEM
	code to call the MC scan done handler.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Fixed some SEL handling and report MC scan done
	when it is done.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Added hacks for broken SDRs.

	* configure.in: Move to version 1.3.3.
	
2004-04-09 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lanserv/emu.c, lanserv/emu.h, lanserv/emu_cmd.c: Added
	capabilities to disable, enable, and remove MCs, also added a
	sleep command.

	* lanserv/lanserv_emu.c: Added support for the sleep command.

2004-04-08 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lib/ipmi_smi.c, lib/ipmi_lan.c, lib/domain.c: Remove the broken
	broadcast handling from the domain code and put it into the
	lower-level code, so the lower level code knows how to time it
	better.

	* lib/domain.c: Add a scan of IPMB 0x20 as the first thing.

	* lib/domain.c: Destroy locks last in a domain.

	* lib/mc.c, lib/entity.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Rework the
	active_handlers dependency between entitys and MCs by using a
	refcount instead of seeing if something is in the active handlers
	list.  Using the list didn't work because external (user) entities
	in the list would keep the MC from being destroyed.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Added a check_hot_swap_state handler.  Fixed
	some problems with getting the hot-swap state.

	* lib/domain.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_domain.h: Added a callback
	to be called when a domain starts shutting down.

	* lanserv/atca.emu: Added a new board.

	* lanserv/emu.c: Fixed problems with event timestamps.

	* lib/domain.c, lib/entity.c, lib/mc.c, lib/oem_atca.c: Fixed a
	host of problems with shutdown order.  It still needs some work
	because of the backwards dependency from entities to MCs created
	by the requirement for active MCs to contribute to entity
	presence.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Create the entities for the items in the shelf
	address table at startup and keep them around.

2004-04-07 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* ui/ui.c: Added an MC active callback to the UI.

	* configure.in: Move to version 1.3.2.

2004-04-02 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lib/sensor.c, lib/control.c: Make sure that calls that send
	messages cannot be done on destroyed sensors.

2004-04-02 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lib/entity.c, lib/sensor.c, lib/control.c: Fixed a rather nasty
	race condition.  Sensors and control may go away after the MC goes
	away underneath them if the sensor or control has an operation
	pending.  The entity routine to remove the sensor and control
	calls ipmi_xxx_convert_to_id(), which requires the MC to exist.
	These were converted to use the pointer itself.

2004-04-02 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com> 

	* lanserv/emu.c, lanserv/emu_cmd.c, lanserv/emu.h: Reworked LED

	never go active.

	* lib/entity.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_entity.c: Added support for
	checking the current hot-swap state (as in an audit).
	
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h.in: Added functions for the above
	call.

	* lib/domain.c: Fix the ordering of OEM handling and reporting
	things so the MC is ready for commands at that time.

	* lib/entity.c: Add checking of hot-swap state along with
	presence.

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: Added an event for the power control.

	* lib/control.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_control.h: Added a way to
	do noseq callbacks to controls.

	when an MC goes active or inactive.

	* lib/entity.c: For entities with FRU data, use the fru device
	(whether the MC is active or not)) to know if the entity is
	present.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_msgbits.h: Add some netfns for the group
	extensions.

	* lanserv/ipmi_checksum.c, lanserv/Makefile.am: Added a small
	program for calculating checksums, useful when working with
	emulator files and FRU info.

	* lib/domain.c: Moved the OEM domain info destroyer callback to
	the end of the domain destruction so that the OEM data is
	available through the destructino process.

	* lib/mc.c, lib/domain.c: Newly created MCs come up inactive by
	default and are set active.

	* lib/oem_atca.c: Lots of little bug fixes, finally getting to
	test it.

	* ui/ui.c: Added multi-record dumping for FRU info.

	* ui/ui.c: Added support for settings-based lights.

	* lib/entity.c: A rework of the entity handling so that entities
	cannot be destroyed while callback handlers are using them.

	* lanserv/emu_cmd.c, lanserv/emu.h: Made command reading halt
	on the first error.

2004-03-31 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	support for IPv6 addresses.

	* sample/sample.c, ui/basic_ui.c, sample/ipmicmd.c: Reworked to
	use the new IPv6 capable interfaces.
	
2003-11-10 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/domain.c: Fixed MC scanning to handle a single address
	properly and fixed some error handling cases.
	
2003-10-30 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/domain.c: Fixed MC scanning to skip addresses properly at
	the beginning of a scan.

	* lib/domain.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_domain.h: Modified the MC
	scanning ignoring to use ranges.

	* lib/domain.c: The previous fix to handle an MC-less case by just
	allowing scanning the BMC at 0x20, not scanning the sysaddr.  The
	sysaddr stuff was just too tied to the redundant BMC case.

	* lib/ipmi_smi.c: Send messages with the proper size.

2003-10-31  Louis Zhuang  <louis.zhuang@linux.intel.com>

	* lib/mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Add const qualifier into function

2003-10-30 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	rereading all the SELs in a domain.

2003-10-23 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/sdr.c: Fixed a bug in the random backof of SDR reading.  On
	a random backoff, it would also start one immediately, too.  This
	was bad because it didn't avoid the contention and it was possible
	to have two SDR readings going on at the same time in the same SDR
	structure.
	
2003-10-23 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/domain.c: If a BMC reports through its channels that is does
	not have an IPMB bus, then force scanning the system address so we
	will find something useful.

2003-10-20 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui/ui.c: Added some code to print the number of SEL entries on
	an mc (when dumping the MC) and the total number of SEL entries
	when listing the SEL.

	* lanserv/lanserv.c, lanserv/lanserv_config.c: Restructured the
	LAN code to make it more flexible and split out more generic
	functions.
	* lanserver/lanserv_emu.c, lanserv/emu.c, lanserv/emu.h: Ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/lanserv.h: Ditto
	
2003-10-17 Tony Griffiths <tonyg@agile.tv>

	and handle incoming messages properly.

	* lib/sdr.c: Null a message data (to keep valgrind happy).

	* ui/ui_os.c: Fixed a problem valgrind found, timer data may be
	freed in the user's handler, but we still used it in the timer
	handler after the call to the user's handler.

2003-10-15 Jeff Zheng <jeff.zheng@intel.com>

	* lib/mc.c: Null out some values on removal.

	* lib/fru.c: Calculate the end of the FRU data correctly.

2003-10-09 Thomas Kanngieser <Thomas.Kanngieser@fci.com>

2003-10-09 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 1.1.4.

	* lanserv/priv_table.c: Fixed the permissions checking code, ADMIN
	privilege was specified incorrectly for unknown messages and magic
	numbers were replaced with defined names.

2003-10-08 Livio Pugliese <lpugliese@uxcomm.com>

	* lib/sensor.c: Added the missing log2() conversion function to
	the array of conversion values.

2003-10-07 Tony Griffiths <tonyg@agile.tv>

	* lib/domain.c: Fix getting the vendor id from the channel info
	response.

2003-10-02 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	to two.

	* lib/mc.c: Removed setting the event receiver for SEL devices
	that are not event generators.

	* ui/ui.c: Fixed problems printing entities.

2003-10-07 Tony Griffiths <tonyg@agile.tv>

	* lib/domain.c: Fixed channel scanning to go on if it gets an
	error from the channel.  That way if channels are not present, it
	will still find channels beyond the errored channel.

	* lib/strings.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_msgbits.h: Add strings for
	the netfns, commands, and errors.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_err.h: ditto

	* lib/ipmi_lan.c: Convert debugging to clean up the formatting and
	use the new strings.

2003-10-05 Thomas Kanngieser <Thomas.Kanngieser@fci.com>

	* lib/sensor.c: The binary search converting from float to raw
	values had the compare backwards.

2003-10-02 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui/entity.c: Fixed the custom info get function names.

	* ui/ui.c: Fixed a few FRU output problems.

	* sample/sample.c: Fixed the FRU output.

	* ui/entity.c, ui/fru.c: Added board manufacture time function.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_fru.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: ditto

	* ui/ui.c: Converted over all display of entities to do the
	relative and absolute entity names.

	* lib/sdr.c: The Get Device SDR command stupidly only returns the
	number of sensors, not the number of SDR entries.  For device
	SDRs, the SDR array will expand up to 512 entries if it runs
	out of SDR entries.  256 is the max number of sensors, so this
	should be safe.

2003-10-02 Thomas Kanngieser <Thomas.Kanngieser@fci.com>

	* lib/sensor.c: The bit shifts for getting the hysteresis and
	threshold support from the SDR were incorrect.

2003-10-01 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 1.1.3

	ipmi_addr.h since it is used in this include file.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_oem.h, lib/mc.c: Allow multiple OEM removal
	handlers to be registered against an MC.
	
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h, lib/Makefile.am, lib/mc.c, lib/chassis.c:
	Added converting chassis control commands to a power control.

	* lib/sdr.c: Don't refetch SDRs if the population is not dynamic.

	* lib/mc.c, lib/domain.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added an
	audit to check the SDRs for an MC and for the main SDR repository.

	* lib/mc.c: Was reading the device SDRs twice.  That's why it was
	so slow at startup.

	* lib/domain.c: Call the connection change function as soon
	as the connection is up, don't wait to read the SDRs, etc.

	* ui/ui.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_ui.h: Add a function to set
	the domain at startup.

	* lib/entity.c: Make sure to free the entity SDR info when it is
	destroyed.

	* lib/domain.c: Initialize the running field of the
	activate_timer_info data.

	* ui/ui.c: Added TCSADRAIN to the tcsetattr() calls so that the
	output wouldn't get chopped off on shutdown of the program.  Also
	properly restored the flags for the output terminal.

	* ui/ui.c: Fixed a possible overrun in normal_char, it was using
	strcpy but the string wasn't necessarily nil terminated.  Change
	to use memcpy with a length.

2003-09-29 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/ipmi.c: The length bits of an IPMI string are the bottom 6
	bits, no the bottom 5 bits.

2003-09-28 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 1.1.2.

	* lib/domain.c: Added handling of system ids in events.

	* lib/domain.c: Don't allow messages to be sent on a shutdown
	domain.  This avoids an infinite loop in some cases.

	* lib/domain.c: In cleanup_domain(), pass the error response in
	as the response, not the original message.

	* lib/entity.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Added entity functions
	to get FRU information so the user doesn't have to deal directly
	with the FRU type.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_fru.h:
	Moved all the FRU functions and types into ipmi_fru.h.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_fru.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_bits.h: Moved
	the chassis types into the public bits.

2003-09-26 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 1.1.1.

	* Lib/ipmi_malloc.c: Fill debug malloced memory with junk to help
	catch usage before initialization.  Also cleaned up some error
	messages.

	entity type definitions to the public part and renamed them, and
	allow getting and setting the type
	* lib/entity.c: ditto

	* include/OpenIPMI/entity.h, lib/entity.c: Reworked the FRU
	handling to be more flexible.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Reworked the entity information to
	make it more understandable.

	* lib/entity.c: Lots of little cleanups for FRU handling and
	handling of SDR records.

	* lib/fru.c: Fixed handling of some data type to find some types
	of errors.

	* lib/ipmi_lan.c: Modified the handling of tunnelling IPMB over
	LAN to work with Intel boxes.  It seems their interpretation of
	the spec is different than mine, but the code should now work with
	both interpretations.

	* lib/ipmi_malloc.c: Don't print some data that we don't have.

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: Updated for FRU handling.

	* ui/ui.c: Added better entity output and FRU change handling.

	* ui/ui.c: Added some FRU handling commands.

	* lib/mc.c: Added entity scanning to device SDRs.
	
	* lib/entity.c: Reworked the entity SDR handling code so that it

	appropriate thing.
	
	* lib/fru.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_fru.h: Added FRU handling code.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: ditto
	* lib/Makefile.am, include/OpenIPMI/Makefile.am: ditto
	* lib/entity.c: ditto

	* lib/mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.c: Allow the entity code to
	store MC-specific SDR information in the MC.

	* lib/domain.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_domain.c: ditto, but for the
	main SDR repository.

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: ditto
	* lib/sensor.c: ditto

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sensor.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h:
	Moved the sdr fetching code to the MC code where it belonged, but
	had to export the sensors waitq to do this.
	* lib/mc.c, lib/sensor.c: ditto

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: Moved
	the string decoding and data decoding functions into the internal

	Livio Pugliese for pointing this out.

2003-09-19 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/selector.c, include/OpenIPMI/selector.h: Change
	sel_select_loop() to return an error if select fails(), instead of
	calling exit().

2003-09-02 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp_intf.c: Changed the timer for MXP messages
	to 20ms and added a 20ms delay between checking for the message
	lock.  Added a 20ms delay after sending 8 messages to let other
	boxes have access.

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: Fixed the -12V voltage sensor on the
	5365 card to be 10% tolerance.

	* lib/mc.c: Fixed process to continue when the SDR fetch
	fails.

	* lib/entity.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Added a way to force
	entity presence detection.

2003-08-27 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/ipmi_lan.c: Fixed reconnection problems. 

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp_intf: Removed connection loss detection from
	the MXP-specific queue fetch, because it is unreliable.  Just use
	the main LAN connection for failure detection.

	* lib/mc.c: Don't cleanup the MC if the SDR read fails.

2003-08-13 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 1.0.3.

	* doc/OpenIPMI.texi: Minor doc updates.

	* lib/domain.c, include/OpenIPIM/ipmiif.h: Added a way for the
	user to know when all the main SDRs have been read.

2003-08-13  Louis Zhuang  <louis.zhuang@linux.intel.com>

	* lib/selector.c: Fixed a trivial bug in process_timers

2003-08-12 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/sdr.c: Added code to the SDR so that it will wait until
	everything outstanding is clear before restarting the fetch
	operation.  Also added a random timer to restart SDR operations
	when the reservation was lost.

	* lib/domain.c: Reworked the code to not start the connection up
	process on an inactive connection.

2003-08-11 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/sdr.c: Fixed a locking bug in the SDR code.

	* lib/domain.c: Modified the set timer code that processes a new
	working connection to wait a while until activating the
	connection.  This allows other connections that may already be
	active to come up.

2003-08-01 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 1.0.2.

	* lib/sensor.c, lib/control.c: Handle NULL controls and sensors in
	opq done.  If a sensor is destroyed during an operation, this can
	be called with NULL.

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp_intf.c: Cleaned up the debug dump output.

2003-07-31 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/domain.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_domain.h: Added a way to
	monitor management controllers as they are added and deleted.

	* lib/domain.c: Minor cleanups for handling the new MXP style of
	addressing.

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: Added monitoring for the AMC card.

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: Split the AMC card handling up to
	completely rework the way the AMCs are handled.  The 0x20 address
	points to the current AMC.  Addresses (f 0) and (f 1) point to the
	individual AMCs.
	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp_intf.c: ditto

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: Made the board entity instances
	one-based instead of zero based.

2003-07-30 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: Made entity instances start at one
	for all entities instead of the random smattering that was there.

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: Fixed power supply events to not use the
	slave address of the power supply when translating events.

	* lib/ipmi_lan.c, lib/oem_motorola_mxp_intf.c: Modified the lan
	connections to make a connection for each IP address instead of
	sharing a connection between IP addresses.  Not all boxes support
	sharing a connection between IP addresses.

	* lib/domain.c: Fixed a problem handling 
	
	* lib/ipmi_lan.c, lib/oem_motorola_mxp_intf.c: Fixed a problem
	where the connection state wouldn't change if only the active
	value changed and not the IPMB address.

2003-07-29 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp.c: Fixed a few little things required
	for the new firmware.

	* lib/oem_motorola_mxp_intf.c: Modified messages directly to the
	system interface to use the sequence number queue from the
	standard IPMI LAN code.  You couldn't use the standard message
	queue because those are one-at-a-time and the messages get gummed
	up in there.

2003-07-25 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* doc/OpenIPMI.texi: Minor doc updates about authentication.

2003-07-24 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/mc.c: Delayed the start of fetching events for an MC's SEL
	until the domain connection is up.

2003-07-23 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lib/entity.c: Fixed searching for the next presence sensor when
	one is deleted.

	* lib/entity.c: Don't set the device num for an entity if the
	instance is not device-relative.  Also, don't add an mcdlr if no
	entity id is specified.

	* lib/entity.c: Fix removal of controls from entities to compare
	properly.

	* lib/ipmi_oem_force_conn.c, lib/oem_force_conn.c: Renamed this
	file to make it more consistent.

	* lib/ipmi.c: ditto
	* ui/basic_ui.c: ditto

2003-07-22 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Moved to version 1.0.1.

	* utils/test_md5.c, utils/test_md2.c: Make the tests run
	standalone.
	
	* lanserv/Makefile.am: Make dependencies for libraries be in
	the build directory, not the source directory.  This way it will
	build in a separate object directory.
	* lib/Makefile.am: ditto
	* sample/Makefile.am: ditto
	* ui/Makefile.am: ditto

	* configure.in: Moved to version 1.0.0.

	* everything: Restructured the entire tree and split up everyting
	into subdirectories.  Hopefully the code is much better structured
	now.

2003-07-21 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmi_smi.c: Added socket interface handling for the SMI
	connection.

2003-07-16 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* OpenIPMI.texi, sensors.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Added
	support for just enabling or disabling sensor event (instead of
	directly setting them), added a bunch of error checking to the
	enabling and disabling of sensors to make sure the sensor supports
	the requested capability.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sensor.c: ditto

	* entity.c: Reworked the presence sensor code to take into account
	the sensor capabilities.

2003-07-11 Louis Zhuang <louis.zhuang@linux.co.intel.com>

	* ipmi_lan.c, lanserv_asf.c, lanserv_ipmi.c: Cleanups to
	remove some warnings.

2003-07-03 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sdr.c: When handling SDR data, be sure to check that the MC is
	valid in responses, so that this properly handles MCs going away.

2003-06-11 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.4.3

	* include/net/af_ipmi.h: Added include file for IPMI socket.

	* lanserv.c: Modified to use IPMI socket if available.

2003-06-07 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* Makefile.am: Clean up so that every '.c' is only listed once.
	When used in multiple programs, create a '.o' in all but one
	instance.  Still need to figure out how to correctly refer to
	.a libraries created by a '.la'.

	* all: License updates.

2003-06-06 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sel.c: Modified to not use the state to tell if something is
	going on, but to use the opq.  Deletes don't modify the state, but
	they may still be in process at deletion.

	* mc.c: Fixed a memory leak.

2003-06-05 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sel.c: Fixed a SEL destruction race condition.

2003-06-04 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* OpenIPMI.tex, README.Force: Minor updates to make some things
	clearer.

	* basic_ui.c: Fixed a problem with SMI connections.

	* ilist.c, ilist.h: Added some helper functions.

	* ui_os.c: Switch from /dev/random to /dev/urandom to avoid
	blocking for lack of entropy.

	* ui.c: Added a total bytes in SDR count.

	* sdr.c: Added a pipeline to the SDR fetch, to speed it up for
	high-latency links.

2003-06-03 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmicmd.c: Added the latency testing code back in.

2003-06-02 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.4.2.

	* sensor.c: Moved the removal of the sensor from the entity to the
	place of its final destruction, so the entity will exist during
	callbacks related to destruction of the sensor.

	* ipmi_lan.c: Send a close session command when the connection is
	closed.

2003-05-30 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* OpenIPMI.texi: Updated docs for handling multiple MCs.

	* domain.c: Add a timer to wait for a while after detecting that
	everyone is inactive before acting.  This should solve race
	conditions where something deactivates one and activates another,
	to avoid an activation war between software devices.

	* domain.c: Reworked some timers so that the handle shutdowns
	correctly.

	* ipmi_lan.c: Changed the failure timeout to 3 seconds.

	* lanserv.c: Send all output to stdout in non-daemon mode.

2003-05-29 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* domain.c: More fixes for supporting multiple connections.

	* entity.c: Fixed the presence handling to use an entity id
	instead of an entity pointer since the entity can go away.

	* ipmi_lan.c: Modified broadcasts to not retry.

	* ipmi_lan.c: Added timer frees in a few places that needed them.

	* ipmi_oem_force_conn.c: Changed the broadcast of the deactivate
	to a normal message so it gets retried.

	* include/linux/ipmi.h: Added changes for setting the timing
	parameters.

	* lanserv.c: Added changes for setting the timing parameters.

	* sdr.c: Fetch sdr 0 to verify the reservation, not the current
	record.  Also fixed some completion stuff.

	* sensor.c: Fixed a shutdown case.

2003-05-28 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sel.c: Fixed a shutdown double-free.

	* sdr.c: Fixed some shutdown free problems.

	* mc.c: Fixed some MC shutdown problems.

	* ilist.c, ilist.h: Set the malloced variable for the supplied
	entry automatically.

	* sdr.c: Removed some bogus frees.

	* mc.c: Set the MC active when it is handled as a new MC.

	* ipmiif.h: Removed ipmi_domain_get_user_data, since it doesn't
	make sense any more.

	* domain.c: Added support for multiple connections to a single
	IPMB box.

	* ipmi_oem_force_conn.c: Added handling for active and inactive
	connections.

2003-05-26 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lanserv.c: Fixed the address reading code to increment the
	address count when it sees an address in the configuration file.

2003-05-19 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c: Modified the event receiver setting code to not modify the
	event receiver unless it is pointing to a nonexistant MC or an MC
	that does not have an event receiver.

2003-05-16 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.4.1
	
	* lanserv_oem_force.c, ipmi_oem_force.c: The permission from
	Force Computers(tm) came much faster than I expected.  This
	included some OEM handling for the various Force cards, for
	switching the cards to/from BMC mode and for fetching the IPMB
	address.  Thanks to Force for their help.
	
	* ipmi.c, lanserv.c, ipmicmd.c: Added calls to initialize the
	Force OEM code.

2003-05-15 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lanserv.h: Moved to include/OpenIPMI
	
	* lanserv.c: Handled move of lanserv.h
	* lanserv_asf.c: ditto
	* lanserv_ipmi.c: ditto
	* lanserv_emu.c: ditto

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.4.0
	
	* ipmicmd.c: Changed the order of the lun and netfn to make it
	consistent with ipmi_ui.

	* ipmicmd.1: Wrote some docs for ipmicmd.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h: Reworked the connection reporting,
	changed "fail" to "change" everywhere to make it more accurate,
	and report all connection changes through the same interface.
	* domain.c: ditto
	* ipmi_lan.c: ditto
	* ipmi_smi.c: ditto
	* ipmicmd.c: ditto
	* sample.c: ditto
	* ui.c: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_lan.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_ui.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: ditto

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, domain.c: Modified the domain
	interface to support more than one connection (although the code
	still only supports one).

2003-05-14 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmi.c, conn.c: Moved some connection handling stuff into a
	new file.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h: ditto

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h: Added a lot of connection handling
	changes for handling different and dynamic IPMB addresses, and for
	supporting the concept of a connection being "active".
	* ipmi.c: ditto
	* ipmi_lan.c: ditto
	* ipmicmd.c: ditto
	* ipmi_smi.c: ditto
	* domain.c: ditto
	* ipmi.c: ditto
	* ipmi.c: ditto

	* lanserv.h, lanserv.c, lanserv_ipmi.c: Added a lot of OEM
	handling.

	* sensor.c: Fixed a missing return.

2003-05-13 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmi.c, ipmi_lan.c, ipmi_smi.c: Added infrastructure so that
	OEMs can see connections by device id when the connection is
	first established.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_oem.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: ditto
	
	* ipmicmd.c: Reworked this so it sits on top of an IPMI
	connection.  This means you can make LAN connection now.

	* ipmi_utils.c: Split out some generic IPMI things that don't
	depend on anything else.
	
	* everything: Added the concept of an IPMI domain, and replaced
	the "BMC" with the "domain".  This was not a huge change from a
	usage point of view, but was a big restructure internally.  This
	way, we can support multiple BMC connections into a domain.

2003-05-05 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Added connection retrying.

2003-05-04 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmi_lan.c: Got IPMI LAN stuff working again.

	* ui.c: Updates for the new id handling.

2003-05-02 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lanserv_emu.c: Added an emulator for testing.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h: Added a way for the interface code
	to provide the IPMB address.
	* mc.c, ipmi_lan.c, ipmi_smi.c: ditto

	* mc.c: Added a valid field to the MC, right now just for BMCs, to
	handle shutdown races.

2003-05-01 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_types.h: A restructure of the id's was
	done to remove the MC validation calls from the rest of the code
	and use the standard MC callbacks.  It also added sequence
	numbers to MCs and MC ids so that if an MC is freed and the same
	memory is re-allocated, the MC still won't compare with an old
	id.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sensor.h: ditto
	* control.c: ditto
	* entity.c: ditto
	* sensor.c: ditto
	* mc.c: ditto
	* sdr.c: ditto
	* sel.c: ditto

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h, ipmi.c: Added a sequence number
	allocator.

2003-04-30 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lanserv.c: Modified the server to support two LAN connections
	specified in the config file, and modified it to always return the
	message from the file descriptor that received the message.

	* mc.c: Modified the SEL time code to set the time on the SEL,
	not get the time, so the SEL time will be correct.

2003-04-29 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmi_lan.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_lan.h: Added multiple IP
	addresses for a BMC.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h: Started restructuring the
	connection code so that the user allocates the connection and
	passed it into the main IPMI code.  This decouples the main IPMI
	code from the connection code, and readies support for having more
	than one BMC connection into a box.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_lan.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_smi.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_ui.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: ditto
	* mc.c: ditto
	* ipmi_lan.c: ditto
	* ipmi_smi.c: ditto
	* basic_ui.c: ditto
	* sample.c: ditto
	* ui.c: ditto

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_types.h: Moved ipmi_con_t as an opaque
	type into here, so the user can access it.
	
2003-04-28 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lanserv.c, lanserv.h, lanserv_ipmi.c: Added logs for error and
	notification handling.

	* lanserv.c, lanserv.h, lanserv_ipmi.c: Added an OEM message
	handler.

2003-04-27 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lanserv.c, lanserv.h, lanserv_ipmi.c: Added timeout handling
	for sessions.

2003-04-26 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lanserv_ipmi.c: Added incoming session sequence number
	checking.

2003-04-25 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* lanserv.c, lanserv_ipmi.c, lanserv_asf.c, lanserv.h: Added a LAN
	to SI interface.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_auth.h: Abstracted the memory allocation
	so the auth routines don't depend on OpenIPMI.
	* ipmi_lan.c: ditto
	* ipmi_auth.c: ditto
	* md2.c, md2.h: ditto
	* md5.c, md5.h: ditto
	* ipmi_lan.c: ditto

	* ipmi_malloc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: Made ipmi_mem_alloc
	take an int size, not a size_t size.

2003-04-24 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* strings.c: Fixed a bug in getting the sensor reading name.

	* priv_table.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_auth.h: Added a table and
	handling for figuring out if a message is permitted for a certain
	priviledge level.
	
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_msgbits.h: Added all the message ids from
	table G-1 from the IPMI 1.5 spec.

2003-04-23 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmi.c, ipmi_auth.c: Created ipmi_auth.c from some stuff in
	ipmi.c

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_msgbits.h: Added a bunch of message ids.

2003-04-22 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmicmd.c, include/linux/ipmi.h: Added a debug interface to
	ipmicmd.

	* ui.c: Added a way to dump all an mc's information.

2003-04-17 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Fixed a double free on set_control error conditions.

	* mc.c: Added set functions for all the specific MC capabilities.

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.3.1.

	* mc.c: Added a mechanism to ignore IPMB addresses.

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.3.0b.

	* ui.c: Ignore control values when an error is reported from
	reading a control.

2003-04-16 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.3.0.

	* mc.c: During shutdown, delete entities after sensors and
	controls because sensors and controls may refer to entities.

2003-04-15 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmi_lan.c: Implemented a max outstanding message count to
	avoid killing a LAN BMC, and implemented a queue to hold extra
	messages.

2003-04-15 Duncan Laurie <duncan@sun.com>

	* ipmi_lan.c: Fix a couple of bits when the Send Message variant
	in lan_send is used.  Fix a double-unlock condition that
	happens with LAN response timeouts.

	* ipmi_lan.c: add a Set Session Privilege Level command to the end
	of the session setup sequence.  It is required because despite
	what you use the in the "privilege level" field in Activate
	Session command it opens in User level.

2003-04-15 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.7.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h, OpenIPMI.texi:  Change the name
	of ipmi_bmc_get_startup_SEL_time() to ipmi_mc_get_startup_SEL_time(),
	in the docs and includes, since it had already changed in the code.

2003-04-14 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.6.

2003-04-10 Louis Zhuang <louis.zhuang@linux.co.intel.com>, Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* include/OpenIPMI/selector.h: Added sel_select() to the include
	file.

	* sample.c: Added an example of using sel_select().

	* selector.c: Some cleanups.

2003-04-03 Duncan Laurie <duncan@sun.com>

	* ipmi_lan.c: Fixups trying to the the lan code working.

2003-04-01 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c: Changed the event receiver setting so that it is always
	done for new MCs, and it is done after the SDRs are read.  That
	way, any pending conditions for a new MC will be generated
	immediately with a valid sensor to handle it.

	* mc.c: Modified event handling so that events from the BMC get
	delivered properly.  It was not converting events from the system
	interface properly.

2003-03-31 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* all: Really release verion 0.2.5.

	* ui.c: Reset the termios on an error exit, too.

	* sdr.c: Fixed the SDR fetch to only fetch the exact amount of
	data left, instead of trying to get as much as possible, when at
	the end of the SDR.  Apparently some hardware doesn't handle this
	properly.

2003-03-27 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ipmi_smi.c: Removed the timing of commands, because the
	low-level driver does it, and it introduced some race conditions.
	Specifically, if OpenIPMI timed out the command and the memory
	address got reused before the message came back in, then the
	message would be delivered to the wrong place.  It generally only
	happened when sitting for a long time in the debugger (so a whole
	slew of things happened at once).

	* example_oem.c, Makefile.am, OpenIPMI.texi: Added an example OEM
	plugin file for others to use to build their plugins.

2003-03-26 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c: Fixed some problems with non-BMC SELs.

	* ui.c: Added a log at startup to tell you to wait until startup
	is complete.

	* ui.c: Added a quit command.

2003-03-25 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: The UI will no longer attempt to read unreadable
	controls.

2003-03-19 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sdr.c: Modified the reservation support handling for device
	SDRs.  Start out assuming that it is supported, and if it returns
	an invalid command then assume it is not supported.  There is no
	clear way to determine if reservation is supported on device SDRs.

	* sdr.c: Check the proper MC flag if it is a sensor SDR to see if
	it supports device SDRs.

	* configure.in: Updated version to 0.2.5.

2003-03-14 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* sensor.c: Yet one more cleanup for compact sensor records,
	increment the source index properly.

	* sensor.c: Removed handle_deleted_sensor() and always use
	ipmi_sensor_destroy() to clean up a sensor.

	* control.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_control.h: Added a count
	for the number of controls in a control repository.

	* sensor.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sensor.h: Added a count
	for the number of sensors in a sensor repository.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added the concept of an
	MC being active or inactive.  Active MCs are present in the
	system.  Inactive MCs are not present but referenced by SDRs, so
	they cannot be deleted.

2003-03-13 Jeff Zheng <Jeff.Zheng@Intel.com>

	* sample.c: Added a simple sample application.

2003-03-12 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c: Fixed a cleanup case in the routine that finds or creates
	an MC.

	* sensor.c: Minor sensor cleanup additions.

	* sensor.c: Fixed compact sensor records to copy the data contents
	instead of the pointer.

2003-03-06 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.4.

	* mc.c: Cleaned up some naming (use bmc when it is a bmc).

	* ui.c, basic_ui.c: Added a "reconnect" command to disconnect and
	reconnect to the BMC.

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.3.

	* mc.c: Added rescanning the entities when a connection comes
	back.

2003-03-05 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Fixed the description of the
	ipmi_bmc_add_con_fail_handler() call to be accurate and complete.

	* mc.c: Added starting a rescan of the IPMB bus when a connection
	comes back.

2003-02-27 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.2.

	* entity.c: Cleaned up entity presence detection so it works
	properly with an entity presence sensor.

	* sdr.c: Fixed a bug where the SDR fetch would go into an infinite
	loop if the last SDR was not a sensor.

	* ui.c: Fixed things so the "-c" option (not full screen) works
	ok.

2003-02-26 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* include/OpenIPMI/os_handler.h: Added thread functions and moved
	all the function OpenIPMI does not use to the end.

2003-02-25 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.2.1.

2003-02-25 Todd David <todd.c.davis@intel.com>

	* ipmi.c: Added a check for the lock actually being allocated in
	ipmi_check_lock().

2003-02-24 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* test1.c, Makefile.am: Removed this bogus file.

	* sensor.c: Handle the same sensor received multiple times from
	the same SDR.  This actually moves the sdr_sensors source array
	into the sensor itself so it can be deleted regardless of where it
	came from.

	* sdr.c: The Get Device SDR Info command is optional (even if the
	device has device SDRs, for some strange reason), so default the
	information if it's not implemented but the device supports device
	SDRs.

	* mc.c: Ignore device SDRs if we get an error back from querying
	them.

2003-02-21 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Moved to version 0.2.0.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_sensor.h
	Added rearm support for sensors.
	* sensor.c: ditto
	* ui.c: ditto

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: The spec was very confusing in
	section 29.11 and 29.14 (1.5 spec) about the event messages and
	scanning enable/disable.  After studying the spec more, I'm pretty
	sure that 1 means enabled and 0 means disabled.  I think the spec
	is saying that 0 means disabled in the way it presents this.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: ditto
	* sensor.c: ditto
	* entity.c: ditto
	* ipmi.c: ditto
	* mc.c: ditto
	* ui.c: ditto

	* mc.c: Changed setting the event receiver for an MC to only do it
	if the event receiver was set incorrectly.

	* sel.c: Fixed a missing unlock.

	* sel.c: Modified the way individual record deletes occur and
	fetches occur to use an opq.  This way, reservations won't get
	mixed up.  Also modified individual deletes to check the value of
	the event before they actually delete it, to make 100% sure they
	are deleting the right event.

	* include/linux/ipmi.h, include/linux/ipmi_msgdefs.h: Converted to
	the new versions of the kernel headers.
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_addr.h: ditto
	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_types.h: ditto
	* ipmi_smi.c: ditto

	* ipmicmd.c, Makefile.am: Added ipmicmd to this code.

2003-02-20 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Fixed a memory leak with controls.

	* sel.c: Make sure to report that a sel delete completed, even if
	we can only clear the whole SEL when all are done.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_msgbits.h: Added event receiver commands.

	* mc.c: Fixed a memory leak deleting logs.

	* ui.c: Added a command to scan an IPMB address.

	* mc.c: Added code to set the event receiver for MCs to whatever
	the current event receiver device is.

	* ipmi.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_addr.h: Added a way to get the
	slave address for an address.

	* mc.c: Since the OEM code can change the values from get device
	id, the comparison code (to tell if an MC has changed) was changed
	to used a real copy of the values from the get device id, instead
	of the used values.

	* Makefile.am, ipmi.c, ipmi_malloc.c: Split off the memory
	debugging stuff into a separate file.

	* Makefile.am: Added heap.h to the file.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_oem.h: Changed the name of the
	MC removal callback to reflect it's function better (since it's
	not BMC-related).

	* entity.c: Fixed a memory leak with presence sensors.

2003-02-19 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_conn.h: Modified the ipmi_init_con()
	call to take the slave address.
	
	* ipmi_lan.c, ipmi_smi.c: Now pass in the slave address to
	ipmi_init_con().

	* OpenIPMI.texi: Updated docs for changes.

	* ui.c: Various cleanups for the SMI address and the new SEL
	setup.
	
	* ilist.c, ilist.h: Added a way to traverse the list backwards.

	* ipmi_smi.c: Converted the BMC to use an SMI address.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added a way for the OEM code
	to add a way to fetch the SMI slave address.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h, sel.c:
	Changed SEL support to be per-MC (as it should be) and not on the
	BMC.  This will allow support for SELs not on the MC, and for
	multiple SEL devices in a system.  It required the removal of
	ipmi_bmc_del_event_by_recid(), and a modification to the event
	structure, since the system now has to know what MC the event came
	from.

	* include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_types.h: Added an MC to the event so we
	know which MC it came from.

2003-02-18 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c: Added a way to set the event enables.

	* sdr.c: Made some of the err info logs unique.

	* mc.c, entity.c: memory leak removals
	
	* ilist.c, ilist.h, ipmi.c: Added separate allocation routines
	for the ilist code.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_oem.h: Added a shutdown callback to
	the OEM registeration.

	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_mc.h: Added global shutdown code for
	the mc.

	* ipmi.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmiif.h: Added global shutdown code.
	
	* ipmi.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: Added memory debugging
	code.
	
	* basic_ui.c: Converted over to the new memory debugging code.
	* control.c: ditto
	* entity.c: ditto
	* ipmi.c: ditto
	* ipmi_lan.c: ditto
	* ipmi_smi.c: ditto
	* mc.c: ditto
	* md2.c: ditto
	* md5.c: ditto
	* opq.c: ditto
	* sdr.c: ditto
	* sel.c: ditto
	* selector.c: ditto
	* sensor.c: ditto
	* ui.c: ditto
	* ui_command.c: ditto
	* ui_keypad.c: ditto
	* ui_os.c: ditto

	* selector.c, heap.h: Split out the heap code into a generic.

	* test_btree.c: Added a test for the heap code.

2003-02-13 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Moved to version 0.1.4.

2003-02-12 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c, sdr.c, sel.c: Changed all 1-bit integers to unsigned so
	that comparisons work properly.
	
2003-02-09 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* configure.in: Moved to version 0.1.3.

	* Makefile.am: Fixed include of "include" dir to be based on
	srcdir, removed -Werror.

	* src.c, selector.c, sel.c, ui.c: Fixed some deprecated
	operations to avoid warnings in gcc3.x.

	events and delete them, instead of clearing the SEL with a
	command.

	operations to take into account deleted events.  Also fixed a bug
	where re-adding an event that was deleted would cause the count to
	be wrong.

2003-01-17 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* ui.c, include/OpenIPMI/ipmi_int.h: Added a debug flag to disable

	the entities and sensors are gone, and the entity was
	auto-created, that the entity itself would be destroyed.

	* sel.c: Reworked the event deletion code so that it works even
	without the ability to delete individual entries.  If all the
	entries in the local database are deleted, it will clear out the
	database (if the reservation hasn't been lost).

	sure something doesn't go wrong here.

2003-01-09 Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>

	* mc.c: Added a periodic rescan of the presence sensors
	periodically (with the bus scan).
	
	* ui.c: Added rescanning of entities when displaying them.
	
	* mc.c, include/OpenIPMI/mc.h, entity.c: Added support for
	handling unhandled (not delivered to the user) events, so the user
	can delete them if they like.

	converted for the mccmd command.
	
	* OpenIPMI.texi: More work on docs.
